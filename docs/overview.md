# Overview

This is a 6-week engineering project to build a portable, intelligent system that can analyze any physical chessboard in real time. Using an overhead camera and a Raspberry Pi, the system detects piece movement, understands the current board state, and communicates seamlessly with a companion mobile app. The mobile app acts as the user interface for interacting with the system, providing real-time feedback, AI-powered gameplay, and post-game analysis. Together, they create a complete “smart chess” experience without requiring a special electronic board.
